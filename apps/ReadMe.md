Applications
============

This is a library of various applications provided out of the box from fabric8.

The applications are packed into an [AppZip](http://fabric8.io/guide/appzip.html) for easier distribution between environments.
See [Apps](http://fabric8.io/guide/apps.html) for more information.

Each application is easily installable in a Kubernetes environment, such as using the [Fabric8 Console](http://fabric8.io/guide/console.html),
or using `kubectl`, `oc`, or [`fabric8:apply`](http://fabric8.io/guide/mavenFabric8Apply.html) CLI command line tooling.
