# Camel CDI HTTP QuickStart

This example shows how to work with Camel in the Java Container using CDI to configure components,
endpoints and beans.

This quickstart is the client side which embeds a Camel route that triggers every 5th second,
and calls a remote HTTP service and logs the response.

The remote HTTP service is the camel-servlet-quickstart which must be up and running.
