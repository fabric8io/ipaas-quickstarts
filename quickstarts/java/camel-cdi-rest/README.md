# REST Client with CXF QuickStart

This quick start is a client for the `quickstarts/war/rest` which is the actual server side REST service that runs inside Apache Tomcat.
This client is a standalone Java application using Camel and CDI.

A Camel route is triggered every 5th second to call the server side REST service and log the response.
