# Web MVC with Spring-Boot QuickStart

This example assumes that you have a running openshift v3, and fabric8 v2 using docker.
For more info see http://fabric8.io/v2/getStarted.html.

This example demonstrates how you can use Spring Boot and web mvc with a [Java Container](http://fabric8.io/gitbook/javaContainer.html)

The quickstart uses Spring Boot to configure a little Spring MVC application that offers a REST service.

When the application is running, you can use a web browser to access the REST service.
